  ## 6. Test
      
  There are 4 test files using jest  (employee, engineer, intern and manager). Each field input is tested based on the questions for the employee. The tests ensure that information such as the name, ID, email and role produce valid results. Within the code, each questions is validated to ensure that there are no blanks or invalid email addresses. At this point, the assumption is that the ID can be alpha-numeric.
